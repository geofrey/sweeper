Minesweeper RPG...when it's finished.

Currently this is JS minesweeper. Grid size and mine count are configurable. Things like 'monster level' are not active yet.
Press 'f' key to mark/unmark a mined square. Flags do not block clicking!

Sweeper is live, [Play it here](http://geofrey.github.io/sweeper/sweeper.html).
