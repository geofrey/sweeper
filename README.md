**Minesweeper RPG!**

Instead of just *finding* all the mines in a board, now you have to *fight* them. It is safe to attack a mine of your own level or lower. Gain levels by defeating mines. Win the game by clearing the entire board.

Board dimensions, max. monster level, monster count, and initial player HP are configurable. Level-up is exponential, first-level XP and XP ratio are configurable for now.

Yes-or-no flags are still active, although perhaps not very helpful.

Obvious bugs
---

* Sometimes the game is not winnable. Still pondering how to do the monster-level distribution.
* Losing the last fight on the board shows the 'win' and 'lose' messages at the same time.
* I have only made images for mine levels 1, 2, and 3. The rest are scribbles. My kids are helping me decide what to draw.
* I'll fix 'em when I fix 'em.
